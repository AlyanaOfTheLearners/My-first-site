      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity threats include viruses, hacking, phishing, and data theft,
        all of which put digital information at risk. Viruses and malware can
        damage systems and files, hacking allows unauthorized access to data,
        phishing tricks users into sharing personal information, and data theft
        results in the loss of sensitive details. Together, these threats can
        cause serious harm to individuals and organizations.

    <section id="root-cause">
      <h2>Root Cause</h2>
      <p>
        Security issues usually occur because many people are generally uninformed
        about the hazards on the internet. Users can be too quick to trust links
        or messages, reuse easy passwords, and forget to update their devices.
        Some systems are also not well protected security-wise, making them vulnerable
        to hackers. With an increasingly online population — shopping, studying,
        and sharing personal information on the web — more opportunities exist
        for cybercriminals to exploit these vulnerabilities.

    <section id="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        The best and easiest solution is to automate safety online, for all users.
        That means turning on tough default security settings, automatic software
        updates, built-in antivirus protection, and two-step verification so people
        do not have to do too much thinking about security. To the extent that systems
        are designed based on user protection by default, they will make fewer errors.
        In addition, brief and clear warnings about online safety can trigger vigilance
        instead of panic.
